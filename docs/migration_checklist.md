## Migration Priority Matrix

### Phase 1: Foundation (High Priority)
1. ✅ Create modular architecture
2. ✅ Add pyproject.toml packaging
3. ✅ Enable pip installation
4. ✅ Add type hints throughout
5. ✅ Create basic test suite
6. ✅ Set up CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 2: Quality (Medium Priority) 
7. ✅ Add static analysis (mypy, ruff)
8. ✅ Multi-platform testing
9. ✅ Automated versioning/releases
10. ✅ Improved documentation
11. ✅ Security scanning

### Phase 3: Advanced (Low Priority)

14. ✅ Performance optimizations
15. ✅ Extended documentation

## Success Criteria

When migration is complete, audit_packages_tool should:

- [x] Be installable via `pip install audit-packages-tool`
- [x] Have a global CLI command `audit-packages` 
- [x] Pass all tests on Python 3.9-3.12
- [x] Have >90% test coverage
- [x] Pass all static analysis checks
- [x] Have automated CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Support semantic versioning and releases
- [x] Have professional documentation
- [x] Follow all Python packaging best practices

## Implementation Notes

- Use modern Python tooling (Poetry/uv, ruff, mypy)
- Follow osv-vulnerability-scanner patterns exactly where applicable
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing CLI usage
- Focus on core functionality first, advanced features later
- Prioritize code quality and maintainability over features
